Sometimes it's just time to move along, and after over 3.5 years at [lumo](https://thinklumo.com) I decided to move to something new. I'm still pretty conflicted about it all, and I have so many thoughts rolling around in my head about CTOing, that I hope to write about some of that some time soon.

In the meatime, I'm now at [Honey](https://joinhoney.com) doing data science, and last week I gave a little talk to the folks at the Boulder office about the basics of machine learning. The audience was primarily made up of engineers with limited exposure to ML, so this was a chance to introduce what I do and give context for why I'm constantly asking all those pesky questions about the data.

Slides are [here](docs/ml-overview-2019.pdf), though my slides tend to be pretty minimal, and the content is mostly in what I say.

One area that I covered is an explanation of alternate and adjacent words for machine learning that come up. Namely, what is the difference between ML and AI? What about predictive analytics and statistical modeling? Mostly, these words discribe very similar things, but usually the community of people using the words differs.

Predictive analytics is primarily used by people coming from business (such as MBAs, economics, analytics) to talk about machine learning. But the subset of machine learning those people tend to do includes supervised learning methods like linear and logistics regression, and less so deep learning and methods that require more programming.

Machine learning covers all methods that take data and output new useful information. This is pretty vague, and that's because ML covers a lot of ground.

Artificial intelligence traditionally refers to algorithms that make computers indistinguishable from humans. A subset of AI is neural networks, which have become very powerful in areas that humans excel in such as vision (is this picture a cat or a mouse?) and natural language processing (based on this text, is the person angry or just being sarcastic?).

Because of this huge revolution in neural networks (deep learning), which are also a machine learning algorithm (after all, neural nets take data and give new info such as whether the image contains a giraffe), there's now a big overlap in AI and ML, and colloguailly people in tech (especially when pitching their startup) now say they are doing AI when in fact that's a laughable stretch.

I like to think that AI is when you're solving a problem that's easy for a human (like understanding that something is a joke...computers aren't great humor...[yet](http://aiweirdness.com/)), and ML is when you're solving a problem that is hard for a human but easier for a computer (like predicting housing prices).

Here's a handy venn diagram:
