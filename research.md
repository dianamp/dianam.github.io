My research interests lie in the applications of operations research, including logistics and supply chains, transportation systems, machine learning, and data mining. I like working with large-scale systems and with lots of data.

My Ph.D. focused on air traffic flow management. Specifically, I developed mathematical models and algorithms whose aim is to improve the efficiency of air traffic flow through terminal airspace (near airports) under stormy (and uncertain) weather conditions.
