Yep, I'm a woman. 

And I've been wanting to write about it, mostly because I get a lot of inspiration from other ladies writing about being professional women. But I'm not really ready to talk about how messed up it is to be called "debatey" or "too quiet" or "aggressive" (yes, I've been called all those by higher ups).

So I'll take it down a notch and instead talk about fashion.

No, I'm not kidding.

I've loved seeing some recent displays of fantastic wardrobe choices at tech conferences. Like [this one](https://twitter.com/caitie/status/649611917233795072/) and [this](https://twitter.com/caitie/status/649404401505959936) ensuing discussion.


And so I thought I would do my part to contribute to the cause of breaking expectations/stereotypes between how women look and how technically capable they are. And to that end, I'm now pledging to don way less hoody, and way more gigantic necklaces, especially when speaking. I'm also seeing some elaborate dresses in my future. 

It's not like the hoodies (or other subdued wardrobe choices) have helped me be taken more seriously in the past, so it's time to move past them.
