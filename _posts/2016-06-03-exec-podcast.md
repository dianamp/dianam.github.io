Something really excited happened: I'm featured on a podcast! As a longtime podcast over-enthusiast (I was listening to Slate's political gapfest before ads on a podcast were even a thing. Now I listen to about 15. How do I find time to do anything?) it was interesting to experience the other side of the table.

Check out the [Exec Podcast](http://execpodcast.com) which focuses on startup engineering leadership, run by [@owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) and [@miles_matthias](https://twitter.com/miles_matthias). I'm in [episode 3](http://execpodcast.com/podcast/0-3-data-science-teaching-community-w-diana-pfeil/) and talk about data science, teaching, and community. Fun times!
