This is a bit of a blast from the past, but way back in May I spoke at the Boulder Startup Week edition of Analyze Boulder on `Auto-generating VC wisdom using recurrent neural networks`.

When I committed to speaking, I thought it would be fun to take on a project related to both startups and deep learning (since I like to be topical, plus the study group I had was still going strong). I ended up scraping all of [Brad Feld's](https://www.feld.com/) blog (he's a VC with a blogging habit), applied a character recurrent neural network using [Torch](http://torch.ch/) and the awesome [torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn) package. 

Here are some sentences the neural net came up with when seeded by the starting phrase in **italics**:

> **My spirit animal** is back to Active Line.

> **Sometimes I fear** where I was there over the years.

> **Boulder is** curating â€“ like the products.

> **Analyze Boulder is** a successful New York Post Media Member.

> **Analyze Boulder** as entrepreneurial communities.
