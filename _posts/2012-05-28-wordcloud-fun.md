It's been awhile since I finished my dissertation - it's about time to summarize it with a word cloud.

Surprise surprise, "weather" appears front and center. If only it had some good synonyms. I used [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/) to generate the word cloud. It would be cool if Wordle handled plurals better, since "route" and "routes" both appear. I'm surprised that the word "probability" appears so small, I had expected it be to huge!
