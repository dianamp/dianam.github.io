I've been floating around at the periphery of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) for years, but besides some Scheme and Lisp in college, I haven't seriously written functional code.

You'd think I would have picked up and internalized some of the FP lingo by now, but somehow I still didn't understand monads and monoids, not to mention functors, adjunctions, and categories.

So, naturally, I did what I love to do when I want to go deep into a topic: I joined a study group focused on category theory! We decided to read through [Seven Sketches in Compositionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316), reading ~10-15 pages each week[^1]. It's been great to be able to discuss the text and review exercises each week, especially because category theory is really self-referential (unlike other areas of math I've worked in), so it can get confusing quick.

After finishing through chapter four, we decided to switch to reading Emily Riehl's [Category Theory in Context](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf), which hilariously defined categories on page 1, whereas the _Seven Sketches_ had waited 3 chapters and 80+ pages to do so!

Now that I know what a functor is (and the other stuff), I'm also hoping to incorporate more FP into my work.

[^1]: There's now a [class corresponding to this book](https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/)! If we were to begin the study group now, we probably would have followed the course contents and youtube lectures.
