I'm an optimization engineer/data hacker based in Boulder, CO. Besides learning new things and trying to optimize everything around me, I like spending time outdoors with my fam.

I spend my work days at [OptTek Systems](http://opttek.com) doing a fun combination of simulation optimization, straight up optimization, and machine learning. I like using Python when I can, and also use R a lot (happily) and Java (not so happily). 

I have a Ph.D in operations research from [MIT's](http://www.mit.edu) [Operations Research Center](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/). While there I worked with Prof [Hamsa Balakrishnan](http://web.mit.edu/hamsa/www/) on air traffic flow management, with an emphasis on integrating weather forecasts with optimization. 

Previously, I studied computer science and math at UC Berkeley, and developed software in the machine learning group at Amazon.com.
