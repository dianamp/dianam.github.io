Hello! I'm a data enthusiast based in Boulder, CO.

I spend my work days as CTO at [Lumo](https://thinklumo.com), where we are doing machine learning for air travel, by predicting flight delay for the travel industry. 

I'm also a co-organizer of [Women in Data Science & Machine Learning Boulder](https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/) and formely co-organized the fantastic data meetup [Analyze Boulder](http://http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/). Each May I'm the track lead for the data science track at [Boulder Startup Week](https://boulderstartupweek.com/)

Besides learning new things and trying to optimize everything around me, I like teaching and speaking (and am increasingly interested in technical leadership), and spending time outdoors with my fam.

I have a Ph.D in operations research from [MIT's](http://www.mit.edu) [Operations Research Center](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/). While there I worked with Prof [Hamsa Balakrishnan](http://web.mit.edu/hamsa/www/) on air traffic flow management, with an emphasis on integrating weather forecasts with optimization. More info about my research is [here](/research/).

Previously, I studied computer science and math at UC Berkeley, and developed software in the machine learning group at Amazon.com. More recently, I did a fun mix of simulation optimization, straight up optimization, and machine learning at [OptTek Systems](http://opttek.com).
