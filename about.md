I'm an optimization and data enthusiast based in Boulder, CO. 

I spend my work days hacking on data (and doing a mishmash of startup-y tasks) as CTO of [Resilient Ops](http://resilientops.com), where we are helping air travelers make smarter decisions by predicting flight delay hours, days, and months in advance. I'm also a co-organizer of the fantastic data meetup [Analyze Boulder](http://http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/).

Besides learning new things and trying to optimize everything around me, I like teaching and speaking, and spending time outdoors with my fam.

I have a Ph.D in operations research from [MIT's](http://www.mit.edu) [Operations Research Center](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/). While there I worked with Prof [Hamsa Balakrishnan](http://web.mit.edu/hamsa/www/) on air traffic flow management, with an emphasis on integrating weather forecasts with optimization. More info about my research is [here](/research/).

Previously, I studied computer science and math at UC Berkeley, and developed software in the machine learning group at Amazon.com. More recently, I did a fun mix of simulation optimization, straight up optimization, and machine learning at [OptTek Systems](http://opttek.com).
